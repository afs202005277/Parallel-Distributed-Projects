## Running instructions:
To run our project, you can simply execute the .bat file present in the root of the project.
This file will use javac to compile all the classes and dependencies of the project.

After compilation, you can just call `java Server` in the terminal and the Server will start.
Secondly, you can run any number of Client instances with `java Client`. These instances will automatically connect to the server.
Finally, for usage instructions, you can use the `help` command in the Client terminal.
